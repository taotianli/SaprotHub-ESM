# Introduction
## abstract_model.py
The `abstract_model.py` file contains the abstract class for all models. 

## model_interface.py
The `model_interface.py` file is used to dynamically load a model.
## saprot
The `saprot` folder contains various implementations for using SaProt model on downstream tasks. Note that 
SaProt shares the same architecture with ESM models, so we can use the same code to fine-tune both SaProt and ESM-2.
